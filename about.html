        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="sectionContent">
          <p>I'm a data analyst and researcher who finds flow in transforming complex healthcare data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and system performance. With dual Master's degrees in Geography (quantitative methods) and Occupational Therapy, I bring a rare combination of statistical rigor, clinical understanding, and deep commitment to health equity.</p>
          
          <p>My career has been driven by a single question: <em>How can we use data to make healthcare more effective, accessible, and equitable?</em> Whether building air quality forecasting models that informed regional policy, conducting geospatial analysis on climate variability, or optimizing clinical workflows in hospital systems, I've consistently sought work at the intersection of analytical depth and meaningful impact.</p>
